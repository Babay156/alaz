Alaz is an open-source Ddosify eBPF agent that can inspect and collect Kubernetes (K8s) service traffic without the need for code instrumentation, sidecars, or service restarts. This is possible due to its use of eBPF technology. Alaz can create a Service Map that helps identify golden signals and problems like high latencies, 5xx errors, zombie services, SQL queries. Additionally, it can gather system information and resources via the Prometheus Node Exporter, which is readily available on the agent. Alaz Docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ddosify/alaz).


‚û°Ô∏è For more information about Ddosify, see [Ddosify](https://github.com/ddosify/ddosify).

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Low-Overhead:** Inspect and collect K8s service traffic without the need for code instrumentation, sidecars, or service restarts.
- ‚úÖ **Effortless:** Ddosify will create the Service Map & Metrics Dashboard that helps identify golden signals and issues such as high latencies, 5xx errors, zombie services.
- ‚úÖ **Prometheus Compatible:** Gather system information and resources via the Prometheus Node Exporter, which is readily available on the agent.
- ‚úÖ **Cloud or On-premise:** Export metrics to [Ddosify Cloud](https://ddosify.com), or install the [Ddosify Self-Hosted](https://github.com/ddosify/ddosify/tree/master/selfhosted) in your infrastructure and manage everything according to your needs.
- ‚úÖ **Test & Observe:** Ddosify Performance Testing and Alaz can work collaboratively. You can start a load test and monitor your system simultaneously. This will help you spot performance issues instantly. Check out the [Ddosify GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ddosify/ddosify) for more information about Ddosify Stack.
- ‚úÖ Works on both Arm64 and x86_64 architectures.

## Getting Started

To use Alaz, you need to have a [Ddosify Cloud](https://app.ddosify.com/register) account or [Ddosify Self-Hosted](https://github.com/ddosify/ddosify/tree/master/selfhosted) installed. 

### ‚òÅÔ∏è For Ddosify Cloud

1. Register for a [Ddosify Cloud account](https://app.ddosify.com/register).
2. Add a cluster on the [Observability page](https://app.ddosify.com/clusters). You will receive a Monitoring ID and instructions.
3. Run the agent on your Kubernetes cluster using the instructions you received. There are two options for Kubernetes deployment: 

#### Using the kubectl

```bash
# Replace <MONITORING_ID> with your monitoring ID from the Ddosify Cloud. Change XXXXX with your monitoring ID.
MONITORING_ID=XXXXX
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddosify/alaz/master/resources/alaz.yaml
sed -i "" "s/<MONITORING_ID>/$MONITORING_ID/g" alaz.yaml
kubectl create namespace ddosify
kubectl apply -f alaz.yaml
```

#### Using the Helm

```bash
# Replace <MONITORING_ID> with your monitoring ID from the Ddosify Cloud. Change XXXXX with your monitoring ID.
MONITORING_ID=XXXXX
helm repo add ddosify https://ddosify.github.io/ddosify-helm-charts/
helm repo update
kubectl create namespace ddosify
helm upgrade --install --namespace ddosify alaz ddosify/alaz --set monitoringID=$MONITORING_ID
```

Then you can view the metrics and Kubernetes Service Map on the [Ddosify Observability dashboard](https://app.ddosify.com/clusters). For more information, see [Ddosify Observability Docs](https://docs.ddosify.com/cloud/observability/).

### üè† For Ddosify Self-Hosted

1. Install [Ddosify Self-Hosted](https://github.com/ddosify/ddosify/tree/master/selfhosted)
2. Add a cluster on the Observability page of your Self-Hosted frontend. You will receive a Monitoring ID and instructions.
2. Run the agent on your Kubernetes cluster using the instructions you received. There are two options for Kubernetes deployment:

#### Using the kubectl

```bash
# Replace <MONITORING_ID> with your monitoring ID from the Ddosify Cloud. Change XXXXX with your monitoring ID.
MONITORING_ID=XXXXX
# Replace <BACKEND_HOST> with your backend host for Ddosify Self-Hosted. Change XXXXX with your backend host.
BACKEND_HOST=XXXXX
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddosify/alaz/master/resources/alaz.yaml
sed -i "" "s/<MONITORING_ID>/$MONITORING_ID/g" alaz.yaml
sed -i "" "s/https://api.ddosify.com:443/$BACKEND_HOST/g" alaz.yaml
kubectl create namespace ddosify
kubectl apply -f alaz.yaml
```

#### Using the Helm

```bash
# Replace <MONITORING_ID> with your monitoring ID from the Ddosify Cloud. Change XXXXX with your monitoring ID.
MONITORING_ID=XXXXX
# Replace <BACKEND_HOST> with your backend host for Ddosify Self-Hosted. Change XXXXX with your backend host. Backend host should be accessible from the Kubernetes cluster.
BACKEND_HOST=XXXXX
helm repo add ddosify https://ddosify.github.io/ddosify-helm-charts/
helm repo update
kubectl create namespace ddosify
helm upgrade --install --namespace ddosify alaz ddosify/alaz --set monitoringID=$MONITORING_ID --set backendHost=$BACKEND_HOST
```

Then you can view the metrics and Kubernetes Service Map on the Ddosify Self-Hosted Observability dashboard. For more information, see [Ddosify Observability Docs](https://docs.ddosify.com/cloud/observability/).

Alaz runs as a DaemonSet on your Kubernetes cluster. It collects metrics and sends them to Ddosify Cloud or Ddosify Self-Hosted. You can view the metrics on the Ddosify Observability dashboard. For the detailed Alaz architecture, see [Alaz Architecture](https://github.com/ddosify/alaz/blob/master/Alaz-Architecture.md).

## Limitations

Alaz runs on Linux Kubernetes clusters. Windows or MacOS are not supported.
In the future, we plan to support Docker containers.

Alaz is an eBPF application that uses [CO-RE](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf#bpf-co-re-compile-once--run-everywhere).
Most of the latest linux distributions support CO-RE. In order to CO-RE to work, the kernel has to built with BTF(bpf type format) information.

You can check your kernel version with ``` uname -r``` 
command and whether btf is enabled by default or not at the  [btfhub](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub/blob/main/docs/supported-distros.md).

For the time being, we expect that btf information is readily available on your system. We'll support all kernels in the upcoming weeks leveraging [btfhub](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub).
